# AZ204 - (26) Host a web application with Azure App Service

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-a-web-app-with-azure-app-service>
- we are going to uze the azure app portal but we can also use the az CLI (better for exam honestly)
- "Azure App Service is a fully managed web application hosting platform. This platform as a service (PaaS) offered by Azure allows you to focus on designing and building your app while Azure takes care of the infrastructure to run and scale your applications."
- yay, lets write some code... mkdir az204-26-webapp and `dotnet new mvc --name MyMvcApp`
- so this script is super useful, it installs dotnet directyl and sets the path variable:

```bash
dotnetversion=3.1.102
wget -q -O - https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --version $dotnetversion
export PATH="~/.dotnet:$PATH"
echo "export PATH=~/.dotnet:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- lets repeat a manual az CLI deployment which sometimes is most definately practical as `az webapp deployment --options...`
- the `az webapp up` is a killer command that creates a service for your current app and deployes it automatically... haha
- the zip deployment is practical and goes as: `az webapp deployment source config-zip --options...`
- WAR deployment is for java apps through KUDU service
- you can use visual studio or FTP/S also...

- assignment publish, zip and deploy as:

```bash
> dotnet publish -c Release -o pub
> cd pub
> zip -r ../site.zip *
> az webapp deployment source config-zip \
    --src site.zip \
    --resource-group learn-822451e3-62ad-46b0-b1d7-481238b289b7 \
    --name az204-vmandic01
```

- and voila the app was deployed...
