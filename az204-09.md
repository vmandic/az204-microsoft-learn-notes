# AZ204 - (9) Enable automatic updates in a web application using Azure Functions and SignalR Service

- case: update application UI for stock price only when the data changes and only update the data on the UI and not the whole screen
- we will be connecting with an input binding to Azure Cosmos DB throug a `stocks` parameter to read the incoming collection data
- the JS function code to read the input binding data is very simple:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req, stocks) {
    context.res.body = stocks;
};
```

- on the frontend we have VueJS client application and axios HTTP to connect with the server on timer based fashion (polling technique)
- to configure your function app host CORS policy use the local.settings.json file configured as:

```json
  "Host" : {
    "LocalHttpPort": 7071,
    "CORS": "http://localhost:8080",
    "CORSCredentials": true
  }
```

- the previous config tells the function app to allow requests from localhost:8080 and accept credential cookies from it
- polling is inefficient for more reasons, delays in time, the package of data becoming to big, too many unneeded data is transferred etc
- now we start to create the resources required for this exercise, starting with storage: mslsigrstorage5803f3adbc
- what I find interesting in this exercise is that the stocks data is polled every 5 seconds and on each of those polls the data is also read from the CosmosDB through the input binding which is a really cool concept geniune to azure functions
- next thing we will do is hook up directly to the change feed of a Cosmos DB collection with SignalR socket connection to frontend
- we created a new HTTPTrigger function "negotiate" (after having a SignalR service created on Azure through az CLI) and added a new binding to it as:

```json
{
    "type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
    "name": "connectionInfo",
    "hubName": "stocks",
    "direction": "in",
    "connectionStringSetting": "AzureSignalRConnectionString"
}
```

- "This configuration allows the function to return the connection information to the server, which is used to identify connected clients."
- the demo for this exercise was really super impressive, everything worked without issues (i did not use F5 to start the whole app but started the client in one terminal and func start in other), next up is hosting the VueJS SPA in a storage account to azure a moving the funcs to azure
- next we are creating a deployment of our local functions from vscode using the Azure Functions plugin and F1 commands pallet
