# AZ204 - (7) Develop, test, and deploy an Azure Function with Visual Studio

- goal: learn building, debugging and deploying functions from the Visual Studio IDE
- Azure functions are fully managed PaaS by Microsoft Azure, as this is mentioned for the first time by now; scalable, resilient, reliable and secure
- one key scenario for developing locally is that you'd like to unit test your azure functions and write code from an IDE which offers full test development tools
- for the nth time we recap on what is an azure function and the input event trigger types such ase blob, event hub, azure cosmos DB, TTP, queue, service bus queue, service bus topic (this is mentioned for the first time) and timer trigger
- before continuing I had to install "Azure development" pack from the VSIDE installer as I did not have it
- one interesting thing shown in the tutorial is that with local development you can use the "Storage emulator" which is a local storage simulation service which allows you to develop locally without the need of a real storage account from the internet ie. real azure account
- currently there are three versions of runtime execution for Azure Functions: v1 (.NET FX 4.7), v2 (.NET Core 2), and v3 (latest), v2 or newer is suggested as v1 allows Windows development only and .NET FX
- we recap azure function execution protection levels:

1. Anonymous - anyone can execute publically on the web if they have the URL
2. Function - must supply a code or x-functions-key header for the exact function in the function app
3. Admin - must supply a code or x-functions key header for the exact function or the admin / host key, this is the shared key in a single function app service

- other function triggers which are not HTTP also require a connection string key, eg. to allow azure storage connection to read / write a blob container change
- we are now exploring the C# / .NET variant of function for the first time as by now we were working with NodeJS / JS runtime variant
- here is the template HTTPTrigger based function:

```csharp
public static class Function1
{
    [FunctionName("Function1")]
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        string name = req.Query["name"];

        string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
        dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
        name = name ?? data?.name;

        return name != null
            ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
            : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
    }
}
```

- another example of a function which is trigger by a blob container change is:

```csharp
public static class Function2
{
    [FunctionName("Function2")]
    public static void Run([BlobTrigger("samples-workitems/{name}", Connection = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")] Stream myBlob, string name, ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} Bytes");
    }
}
```

- now we actually create the sample HTTPTrigger based function in VSIDE for C# .NET Core 2 runtime (v2 functions)
- the first noticable difference is that C# functions handle input bindings through C# attributes and not through a function.json file as do JS ones
- after creating and testing the function locally we proceed to publishing from VSIDE: you can choose CICD services / solutions or zip deployment
- I finished the deployment with the ARM template file because I could not get the subscription to list out my learning resource group for some reason, my functions was successfuly deployed as testble from: <https://myfunctionapp-vmandic01.azurewebsites.net/api/WatchInfo?model=abc>
- after deployment we move on to unit testing the azure function with xUnit library
