# AZ204 - (11) Publish and manage your APIs with Azure API Management

- we expand on what we learned in 10 with APIM and now add security and usage policies
- "In this module, you'll create an API gateway to securely publish an API. To call the API in the same manner as an authorized app, you'll also use an API Management subscription key. At the end of this module, you'll be able to use API Management to publish any API."
- benefits of using API management

1. API documentation
2. Rate limiting access
3. Health monitoring
4. Transform data formats
5. Connect to any API
6. Analytics
7. Security

- APIM differes pricing tiers:

1. developer - only evaluation
2. basic - 99.9& SLA 1k req/sec, 2 SU (scale unit)
3. standard - 99.9SLA 2.5K req/sec, 4 SU
4. premium - multi region, 99.95% SLA 4k req/sec 10 SU/region
5. consumption - serverless, scale up on demand, has autoscaling, provisions quicker

- scenario: we are a shoe company who wants to unify multiple APIs under one API with Azure APIM
- this is the first time in this whole challenge that we are creating an Azure App Service for a full .NET Core web API
- we clone the full app from github and run its setup.sh that will generate the public web app exposing a swagger OpenAPI interface
- and just like that the whole appservice is deployed and running: <https://shoecoapia49f59a3e4.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html>
- the APIM service instance groups "APIs", the API "is a standardized way for organizations to expose specific data to potential developers or partners"
- there are different API frameworks:

1. Blank API (any API then manually specify all required params)
2. Open API (swagger REST API)
3. WADL (simpler than WSDL format, xml)
4. WSDL (xml, not just HTTP)
5. Logic App (azure)
6. API App (azure app service app)
7. Function App (azure)

- a special feature of APIM is policies, they "provide powerful capabilities to change the behavior of an API through configuration. They exist as a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API."
- popular policies include:

1. conversion from XML to JSON
2. call rate limiting to restrict the number of incoming calls to a service endpoint
3. setting inbound and outbound headers

- inside APIM the APIs are associated with products for the target audience configurable from the portal; for non-consumption there are two product types __starter__ and __unlimited__
- "Products let you group APIs, define terms of use, and runtime policies. API consumers can subscribe to a product on the developer portal to obtain a key to call your APIs." -> basically, a product is virtual API (groupping) that includes other APIs
- to access a published APIM gateway you need a subscription key which is used for access restriction of undesired callers
- "A subscription key is a unique auto-generated string which needs to be passed through in the headers of the client request."
- you can scope an APIM subscription key as:

1. All APIs
2. A single API
3. A product

- "Applications that call a protected API must include the key in request calls."
- default APIM access subscription key header is `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` or query parameter `subscription-key`
- **"For products where subscriptions are enabled, you must supply a key when making calls to APIs in that product. As a developer, you can obtain a key by submitting a subscription request. This is a core part of the APIM workflow."**
- here is an example primary key (a secondary always also exists so we can swap them easily): e04be66c8e8140a9823e5f22b9523edc, and a full API call would look like `GET https://apim-northwindshoes-vmandic01.azure-api.net/api/products?subscription-key=e04be66c8e8140a9823e5f22b9523edc`
