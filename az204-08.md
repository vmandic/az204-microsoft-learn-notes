# AZ204 - (8) Monitor GitHub events by using a webhook with Azure Functions

- webhooks are basically REST API HTTP call event handlers which happen on some events on some service of your interest
- an eg. case "use a function as the listener for GitHub Wiki update event" and forward that event data somewhere else, eg. MS teams chat or channel
- module goal: "By the end of this module, you'll learn how to create a function triggered by a webhook and how to secure a webhook message, or payload, with a secret."
- "One common use of webhooks in a DevOps environment is to notify an Azure function that the code or configuration for an application has changed in GitHub"
- we now create a new NodeJS function app **with a HTTPTrigger**
- after testing the funciton, we go to GitHub and set up a webhook over there, specially the __Gollum__ event which is triggered when we edit a wiki on a target repository which has webhooks set up
- after setting up the webhook i modified the JS code to send hook data back in response:

```javascript
if (req.body.repository.name){
    context.res = {
        body: "Repository is: " + req.body.repository.name + ", Event Type is: " + req.headers['x-github-event']
    };
}
```

- adding the secret part besides the payload URL and payload type will ensure our hook data is really sent from GitHub to the Azure Function
- by adding the secret a `x-hub-signature` HTTP header is appendend on hook HTTP sending to our function, the value in it will be a hash signature for each payload
- GitHub uses an HMAC SHA1 hex digest to compute the hash, so we need to recompute the has on our side to ensure the received message integrity
- as we are using the NodeJS stack we will use crypto-js library (probably npm preinstalled?) as `const Crypto = require('crypto');`
- we finsihed the module by testing webhooks with and without a secret which isused to produce a SHA1 MAC hash signature of the payload to verify that the incoming message in our azure function is really from github
