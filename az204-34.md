# AZ204 - (34) Configure and manage secrets in Azure Key Vault

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/configure-and-manage-azure-key-vault>
- **"Azure Key Vault helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets that cloud applications and services use."**
- three primary concepts used in an Azure Key Vault: **vaults, keys, and secrets**
- vaults are groupings, like folders, where we store keys and secrets
- enables HSM (hardware protected keys) for protection - BYOK (bring your own key)
- "For production use, it's recommended to use HSM-protected keys and use software-protected keys in only test/pilot scenarios."

- here is a PS1 script to specify storing in HSM instead of sfotware based module:
  
  ```powershell
  $key = Add-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName 'contoso' -Name 'MyFirstKey' -Destination 'HSM'
  ```

- "Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources."
- "Azure Resource Manager can securely deploy certificates stored in Azure Key Vault to Azure VMs when the VMs are deployed."

## Management and data plane

- two aspects of using the Key Vault, where having access to management one can allow themselves access to data plane

## Authentication

- "Azure Key Vault uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authenticate users and apps that try to access a vault."
- **"There is no support for anonymous access to a Key Vault."**
- two RBAC based roles are Key Vault Contributor for managing the data - keys, and Contributor the one who manages the key vault itself
- to manage control under a key vault ie. its data you can create access policies
- "Developers will only need Get and List permissions to a development-environment vault."

- "you can import existing certificates - this allows you to add certificates to Key Vault that you are already using. The imported certificate can be in either **PFX or PEM format** and must contain the private key."

- very disappointed  that in this course we did not build a C# app to read secrets! :-(
