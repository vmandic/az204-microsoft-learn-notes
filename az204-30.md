# AZ204 - (30) Deploy and run a containerized web app with Azure App Service

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/deploy-run-container-app-service>
- "You can build and deploy Azure-based web apps by using Docker containers"
- to save docker images to azure we use Azure Container Registry service
- "Like Docker Hub, Container Registry is organized around repositories that contain one or more images."
- creating an azure container registry: `az acr create --name myregistry --resource-group mygroup --sku standard --admin-enabled true`
- building images in acr: `az acr build --file Dockerfile --registry myregistry --image myimage .` "use the CLI to upload the Docker file and other files that make up your image. Container Registry will then build the image for you"
- mkdir az24-30 ... :-)

- here is a sample docker file we pushed and built in acr:

```dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["SampleWeb/SampleWeb.csproj", "SampleWeb/"]
RUN dotnet restore "SampleWeb/SampleWeb.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/SampleWeb"
RUN dotnet build "SampleWeb.csproj" -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "SampleWeb.csproj" -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SampleWeb.dll"]
```

- instead of using the portal I will try and set up a webapp from CLI...
- actually managed that, first i created an app service plan, then a webapp with: `az webapp create -n app -g group --plan plan -i vmandic01.azurecr.io/webimage:latest`

- **You use the tasks feature of Container Registry to rebuild your image whenever its source code changes automatically.**
- tasks can be created from az CLI as: `az acr task create`
- here is a sample ACR task that watches a git repo and pulls its latest code to build a latest image:

```bash
az acr task create \
--registry <container_registry_name> \ 
--name buildwebapp \
--image webimage \
--context https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-deploy-run-container-app-service.git \
--file Dockerfile \
--git-access-token <access_token>
```

- before running the previous command, we need to create a GitHub personal access token with permissions to create a webhook in your repository
- so we enabled CICD based on the docker image webimage:latest being refreshed in the ACR, we did that by enabling the CICD feature under setting of webapp service and by using its webhook to register a new webhook in webhooks of the container registry service instance we created earlier
