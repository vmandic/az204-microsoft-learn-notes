# AZ204 - (22) Create a Linux virtual machine in Azure

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-linux-virtual-machine-in-azure>
- case: moving existing Linux real infra to cloud infra VM, an Apache web server and app on it for monitoring car racing events
- basically we are recaping #21 but lets do it for the sake of learning what the components of a VM are:

1. CPU and memory resources (the VM size)
2. An Azure Storage account to hold the VHD
3. VHDs to hold the OS, apps and data
4. a VNet to connect the VM to other Azure services or on-prem services
5. a NIC to connect to VNet
6. an optional publich IP address
7. a network security group to control inbound and outbound ports
8. a resource group to hold all the previous resources "under one hat"

# VM sizes recap

- general purpose: B, Dsv3, Dv3, DSv2, Dv2
- high compute: Fsv2, Fs, F
- large memory: Esv3, Ev3, M, GS, G, DSv2, Dv2
- storage and processing: Ls
- GPU processing: NV, NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND
- high perf compute HPC: H

- for Linux by default you get two VHDs: OS /dev/sda (max 2 GBs) one and temporary disk /dev/sdb (mounted to /mnt), **temp is ephemeral**, do not treat as stateful
- VHDs storage is meassured in GiBi, not GB
- "An interesting capability is to create a VHD image from a real disk. This allows you to easily migrate existing information from an on-premises computer to the cloud."
- two types of disks unmanaged and managed

## Remote connecting to Linux VM

- we will use SSH with SSH key pair instead of username / password (vulnerable to brute force attacks)
- to generate a key pair you can use `ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096` CLI tool
- to copy the generated and passphrased private key to linux VM use the CLI command: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub azureuser@myserver`

- assignment: we are deploying a new Linux Ubuntu Server 16 LTS VM through the portal guided with the module course instructions, one specific setting is using the SSH public key we generated in the azure shell
- **IP address reassignment: "for VMs the IP address assignment happens when the VM is restarted."**

- related to NSGs and VMs: **"For inbound traffic, Azure processes the security group associated to the subnet, and then the security group applied to the network interface. Outbound traffic is handled in the opposite order (the network interface first, followed by the subnet)."**

- we finsihed after successfully connection to the VM through SSH, i used Windows Terminal and WSL2 from my PC after I created an id_rsa copy of the private key in my ~/.ssh directory of WSL2
