# az204 - (27) Publish a web app to Azure with Visual Studio

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-azure-web-app-with-visual-studio>
- i think I know this by heart... but lets go through it
- "Free and Shared plans are best for small-scale personal projects with limited traffic demands, with a set limit of 165 MB of outbound data every 24 hours." - was not aware of the 165 MB of outbound traffic data
- one new thing I learned is that razor views are by default precompiled and one can enable razor runtime compilation with:
- (but first Install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation` NuGet package.)

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages()
        .AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();

    // code omitted for brevity
}
```

- or the razor compilation can also be enabled through env variable `ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES = "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation"`
