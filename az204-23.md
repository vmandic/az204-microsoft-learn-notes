# AZ204 - (23) Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure>
- "In this unit, you will learn how to create a VM using the Azure portal. You will configure the VM for remote access, select a VM image, and choose the proper storage option."
- "They include processor, memory, storage, and networking resources."
- we are now repeating literllay everyting as we did for Linux VMs, and are starting by choosing a VM image, or creating and own one
- as with Linux VHDs you get two, C: with max 2 GB and temp drive D: used for paging memory and is ephemeral
- as with Linux VHDs we have unmanaged and managed disks, unamanged is all up to the user and a rate limit of 20000 IOPS per Storage Account, meaning you can have 40 standard VHDs at full throttle, for scaling out you will need more storage accounts
- managed disks are newer and more recommended (standard or premium) and you do not have to worry about storage account limits, offer reliability, security and **snapshot support** and automatic backup support
- a special difference here is that we will use RDP 3389 port to connect into the VM OS, the VM allows RDP, SSH and Bastion connections ("Bastion is an Azure service that allows fast, secure connections to any VM within a VNet.")

- lets add additional content to this, create vm with az CLI:

```bash
az vm create \
--name my-vm-01
-g $resg
--admin-username vmandic01
--admin-password supers_tronGPassword0#
--image UbuntuLTS
--size Standard_DS1_v2
--storage-sku Standard_LRS
```

- to view az vm sizes you can use: `az vm list-sizes`
- if you wish to create an ARM template of the VM without creatiting resourcess add `--validate` option
