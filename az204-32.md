# AZ204 - (32) Top 5 security items to consider before pushing to production

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/top-5-security-items-to-consider>
- we explore azure security center (ASC)
- its a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all services in azure and on-prem
- there are two pricing tiers: FREE and Standard
- and these are now called Azure Defender OFF and Azure Defender ON ... (the MS Learn site is out of date as I write this)
- now we read about the importance of validating and sanitizing input (but also transforming)

- "Azure Key Vault is a secret store: a centralized cloud service for storing application secrets."
- "Key Vault is designed to store configuration secrets for server applications. It's not intended for storing data belonging to your app's users, and it shouldn't be used in the client-side part of an app. This is reflected in its performance characteristics, API, and cost model."

- now there is a unit in the course on keeping your frameworks up to date and secure by using the built-in features of frameworks
- "When using Azure to host your web applications, Security Center will warn you if your frameworks are out of date as part of the recommendations tab. Don't forget to look there from time to time to see if there are any warnings related to your apps."

- always keep an eye for CVE database and OWASP guides, always keep track of your third-party dependency library code
