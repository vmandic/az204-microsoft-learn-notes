# AZ204 - (28) Stage a web app deployment for testing and rollback by using App Service deployment slots

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/stage-deploy-app-service-deployment-slots>
- we will learn how to "Create a deployment slot as a staging environment in App Service.", git deploy the app, change app settings depending on deployment slot and how to swap deployment slots or roll back a deployment
- "Within a single Azure App Service web app, you can create multiple deployment slots."
- "New slots always begin with no content. You must deploy content by using git or another deployment strategy. The clone operation copies the configuration to the new slot. **After you clone the settings, the configuration of the two slots can be changed independently.**"
- "The new slot is effectively a separate web app with a different hostname. That's why anyone on the internet can access it if they know that hostname."
- we git cloned a finsihed app, create a new .NET 4.8 mvc app service, pushed code to its local git which we set up with its credentials
- then, we created one deployment slot besides the PRODUCTION one (also to be able to have deployments slots >= STANDARD app service plans must be used)
- then, we pushed to production slot `git push production` before that having `git remote add production azure.com/thegenerateazurerepofor_deployment_slot1.git`
- then we tested the app and its there, it was built on the fly, which is awesome
- then we added remote `git remote add staging azure.com/stagingrepo_slot2.git` we changed some index.chtml code and git commit and `git push staging` basically we pushed the changes to the staging slot
- then we performed a slot swap, took 2-3 minutes
- "To help you discover problems before your app goes live into production, Azure App Service offers a swap-with-preview feature. When you choose this option, the swap proceeds in two phases:" - it is a two-phase swap, where in 1. the TO-BE (source) slot gets appsettings of AS-IS (target) slot, then we can check if its ok on its hostname directly, if ok in 2. we proceed to swap the hostnames and thats it...
- "Auto swap brings the zero-downtime and easy rollback benefits of swap-based deployment to automated deployment pipelines. When you configure a slot for auto swap, **Azure automatically swaps it whenever you push code or content into that slot.**"
- **"Auto swap is not available in App Service on Linux."** - This option is only available on slots other than the production slot
