# AZ204 - (14) Communicate between applications with Azure Queue storage

- case: major new organization report breaking news alerts which miss out some times when journalists rush to upload larger breaking stories at the same time and we will be solving this issue with Azure Storage Queues
- "A storage queue is a high-performance message buffer that can act as a broker between the front-end components (the "producers") and the middle tier (the "consumer")."
- we will learn to create a queue client, add, retrieve, and remove messages from a queue using C# and the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET
- "Typically, you will have one or more sender components and one or more receiver components."
- **"A single queue can be up to 500 TB in size"**
- "The target throughput for a single queue is 2000 messages per second"
- in terms of Azure Storage Queue a message is "a byte array of up to 64 KB"

## Storage account considerations for queues

- "Queues are only available as part of Azure general-purpose storage accounts (v1 or v2). You cannot add them to Blob storage accounts"
- "The Access tier setting which is shown for StorageV2 accounts applies only to Blob storage and does not affect queues"
- "You should choose a location that is close to either the source components or destination components or (preferably) both"
- "Data is always replicated to multiple servers to guard against disk failures and other hardware problems. You have a choice of replication strategies: Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is low-cost but vulnerable to disasters that affect an entire data center while Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) replicates data to other Azure data centers"
- "The performance tier determines how your messages are stored: **Standard uses magnetic drives while Premium uses solid-state drives.** Choose Standard if you expect peaks in demand to be short. Consider Premium if queue length sometimes becomes long and you need to minimize the time to access messages"
- "Require secure transfer if sensitive information may pass through the queue. This setting ensures that all connections to the queue are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"
