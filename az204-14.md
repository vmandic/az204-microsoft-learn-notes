# AZ204 - (14) Communicate between applications with Azure Queue storage

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/communicate-between-apps-with-azure-queue-storage>
- case: major new organization report breaking news alerts which miss out some times when journalists rush to upload larger breaking stories at the same time and we will be solving this issue with Azure Storage Queues
- "A storage queue is a high-performance message buffer that can act as a broker between the front-end components (the "producers") and the middle tier (the "consumer")."
- we will learn to create a queue client, add, retrieve, and remove messages from a queue using C# and the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET
- "Typically, you will have one or more sender components and one or more receiver components."
- **"A single queue can be up to 500 TB in size"**
- "The target throughput for a single queue is 2000 messages per second"
- in terms of Azure Storage Queue a message is "a byte array of up to 64 KB"

## Storage account considerations for queues

- "Queues are only available as part of Azure general-purpose storage accounts (v1 or v2). You cannot add them to Blob storage accounts"
- "The Access tier setting which is shown for StorageV2 accounts applies only to Blob storage and does not affect queues"
- "You should choose a location that is close to either the source components or destination components or (preferably) both"
- "Data is always replicated to multiple servers to guard against disk failures and other hardware problems. You have a choice of replication strategies: Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is low-cost but vulnerable to disasters that affect an entire data center while Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) replicates data to other Azure data centers"
- "The performance tier determines how your messages are stored: **Standard uses magnetic drives while Premium uses solid-state drives.** Choose Standard if you expect peaks in demand to be short. Consider Premium if queue length sometimes becomes long and you need to minimize the time to access messages"
- "Require secure transfer if sensitive information may pass through the queue. This setting ensures that all connections to the queue are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"

## Accessing a storage account

You will need three pieces of data:

1. Storage account name
2. Queue name
3. Authorization token (AAD, shared key (like a root pwd) or SAS (shared access signature))

- the queue can be accesed through a REST API by sepcifying the storage account URL/queue name addres and an Authorization header must be included in every requesst
- when using the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET then the address and key are put together in a connection string which is provided to the queue client instance in the CTOR
- an example of a connection string is: `"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<your storage account name>;AccountKey=<your key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"`

- assignment: create a dotnet core console app with a queue client in it
- to use a client we need to provide it a valid connection string, to get one with az CLI type the following: `az storage account show-connection-string --name vmandic03` which prints out a json response with the connection string to be used when instantiating a queue client
- having the receiver to get and then delete the message a "at-least-once" strategy is implemented, meaning that sometimes a message could be received multiple times due to issues on the receiver not issuing a delete request back to the queue: "after the receiver gets a message, that message remains in the queue but is invisible for 30 seconds. If the receiver crashes or experiences a power failure during processing, then it will never delete the message from the queue. After 30 seconds, the message will reappear in the queue and another instance of the receiver can process it to completion."
- to program interaction with the Azure Storage Queue we have 4 classes at dispossal **(legacy way of doing it...)**

1. `CloudStorageAccount` - the storage account interface
2. `CloudQueueClient` - the queue client for the storage
3. `CloudQueue` - the specific queue of a storage
4. `CloudQueueMessage` - a message instance for the queue

- the **(latest)** .NET API is available through the NuGet lib: `Azure.Storage.Queues`

- now I am going to test this locally by building a whole console app to send a message... so my head just exploded as I tried to do this with VSCode on my PC as there is not autocomplete and omnisharp is useless, but I figured out that there are TWO variants of connecting to the storage queue client code the .NET v11 and .NET v12 as per explained in MSDN tutorial: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-tutorial-queues?tabs=dotnet>
- the legacy way is by installing two nuget packages `dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Common Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Queue` and using the classes above and the new way is by installing `dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Queues` and using the `QueueClient` class the same as for the service bus
- there is also thrid legacy-legacy version: `dotnet add package WindowsAzure.Storage`
- so here is the whole app wtih the legacy-legacy approach:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Queue;

namespace QueueApp
{
    class Program
    {
        const string connectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=vmandic03;AccountKey=ykNGxJZF4+HfvspUUsnH1opedBqqkI6Yn+iKDYJs+o+9k1kuho9Ip28H+IwiO4QFBNit3MlTQGrvi/0cWBiT8g==";
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            if (args.Length > 0)
            {
                string value = String.Join(" ", args);
                await SendArticleAsync(value);
                Console.WriteLine($"Sent: {value}");
            }
            else
            {
                string value = await ReceiveArticleAsync();
                Console.WriteLine($"Received {value}");
            }
        }

        static async Task<string> ReceiveArticleAsync()
        {
            CloudQueue queue = GetQueue();
            bool exists = await queue.ExistsAsync();

            if (exists)
            {
                CloudQueueMessage retrievedArticle = await queue.GetMessageAsync();
                if (retrievedArticle is object)
                {
                    string newsMessage = retrievedArticle.AsString;
                    await queue.DeleteMessageAsync(retrievedArticle);

                    return newsMessage;
                }
            }

            return "<queue empty or not created>";
        }

        static CloudQueue GetQueue()
        {
            CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString);

            CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();
            return queueClient.GetQueueReference("newsqueue");
        }

        static async Task SendArticleAsync(string newsMessage)
        {
            var cloudQueue = GetQueue();

            bool isQueueCreated = await cloudQueue.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

            if (isQueueCreated)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("The queue of news articles was created.");
            }

            var message = new CloudQueueMessage(newsMessage);
            await cloudQueue.AddMessageAsync(message);
        }
    }
}
```

- so this was a cumbersome experience :(
