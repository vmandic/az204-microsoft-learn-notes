# AZ204 - (21) Introduction to Azure virtual machines

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-virtual-machines>
- in this course module we will learn about azure VM offerings
- before starting to provision VMs one should sketch out the existing or new infrastructure they wish to establish in the azure cloud
- some questions to consider when planning a VM usage are: VM sizes (memory/CPU/storage), networking (NIC, network sec group, vNet, private or public IP), scaling, selcting an OS, securing access, connecting to VMs for management...
- you should always first start off with the virtual network creating virtual network address spaces eg. one or multiple subnets in which you could organize services
- "Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address in each subnet for its use."
- by setting NSGs (network security groups) you can control how subnets can interconnect - basically they act as software firewalls
- when naming a VM consider that 15 max chars is for Windows OSes and 64 for Linuxe OSes
- when deciding on VM sizes consider different categories: general purpose, compute, memory, storage, GPU and high perf based VM categories
- "Azure allows you to change the VM size when the existing size no longer meets your needs. You can upgrade or downgrade the VM - as long as your current hardware configuration is allowed in the new size. This provides a fully agile and elastic approach to VM management."
- "You might be able to save money by reusing existing licenses for Windows with the Azure Hybrid benefit." - Windows VMs are more expensive than Linux due to OS licence price inclusion
- when choosing how to pay for VMs you can select pay-as-you-go or reserved instances (RIs), RIs can be taken for 1 or 3 years with 30 to 70% discounts
- for creating a virtual machine from az CLI you can use a command like:

```shell
az vm create \
-g $resg \
--name dev-myvm-01 \
--image win2016datacenter \
--admin-username vmandic
--admin-password SuperStrongPassword000#
```

- besides creating VMs from CLI you can use PowerShell cmdlets like `New-AzVm` or REST API directly or client side libs like .NET Azure SDK or resource template JSON files for automation
- azure allows you to run "Azure VM extensions" which can be executed after deploying a VM to additionally administer or install software on the VM itself, you can run them with CLI, PS or resource manager templates and through the portal

## Azure automation

- enables integrating services for frequent automation to efficiently manage **process, configuration and update management**
- Configuration Management is instrumented through Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager - lets you manage updates and requirements of software on your VMs

## Managing availability of VMs

- "Microsoft does not automatically update your VMs OS or software. You have complete control and responsibility for that."
- "To ensure your services aren't interrupted and avoid a single point of failure, it's recommended to deploy at least two instances of each VM. This feature is called an **availability set.**"
- **"When you place VMs into an availability set, Azure guarantees to spread them across Fault Domains and Update Domains."**
- having VMs across fault domains and update domains makes the safe from failures casued by hardware failure or updates causing VM reboot
- besides ensuring that an availability set is in another server rack physically we can ensure secondary zone redundancy with a secondary location in another availability zone with **Azure Site Recovery**
- "If an outage happens at your primary site, you can fail over to a secondary location. This failover enables users to continue to access your applications without interruption."
- VMs can use **Azure Backup** service to maintain and manage backups
