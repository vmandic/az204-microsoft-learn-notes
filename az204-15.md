# AZ204 - (15) Enable reliable messaging for Big Data applications using Azure Event Hubs

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/enable-reliable-messaging-for-big-data-apps-using-event-hubs>
- case: credit card processing system which has to handle weekend and holiday spikes of card processing business
- "Azure Event Hubs can receive and process a large number of transactions. It can also be configured to scale dynamically, when required, to handle increased throughput."
- azure event hubs is an **"event-processing service that can receive and process millions of events per second."**
- the entity sending events is known as a publisher and the entity reading messages is known as subscriber or consumer
- the core idea of event hubs is to decouple the very demanding message production from a slower message consumer acting as a stateful middleware between the two holding the events up to the moment when the consumer can pick them up for processing
- **the array of events are limited to a size of 1 MB, and one event in it is limited to max 64 KB**
- "Event publishers are any app or device that can send out events using either HTTPS or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) 1.0.", "Existing Kafka-based clients, using Apache Kafka 1.0"
- subscriber apps use two methods to read events:

1. EventHubReceiver - simple and limited options
2. EventProcessorHost - efficient

- event hubs use the concept of consumer groups to group events for subscribers ie. allow subscribers to get only an interesting portion of events

## Event hubs pricing

Pricing features differ in number of supported connectons, number of consumer groups and throughput

1. basic
2. standard (default, 20 consumer groups and 1000 brokered connections)
3. dedicated

- when creating an event hub one must first create a namespace for it and then a hub in the namespace, something like a function app which can contain multiple functions
- when configuring the namesapce settings one should always keep in mind the budget that is going to be charged / spent
- the selected namespace will be on the subdomain of servicebus.windows.net
- a powerful feature is to allow Kafka to stream events into event hub service, you need to enable this on namespace settings
- the namespace can be made zone redundant
- the "auto-inflate" feature allows automatic scale-up by increasing throughput units
- to create an event hub namespace instance use command: `az eventhubs namespace create`
- event hubs within the same namesapce share the same common connection crdentials, ie. connection string
- the **partition count** setting of a hub should reflect the number of maximum concurrent consumers and should be between 2 and 32, can not be changed after hub creation, defaults to 4
- to create eventhubs in a namespace use the command: `az eventhubs eventhub create`
- az shell offers setting defaults, which we will do as: `az configure --defaults group=learn-9da64396-19b5-4147-a762-a62ec3f6fbc7 location=westus2`
- assignment: create a namespace: `az eventhubs namespace create --name vmandic01`, takes 2 minutes...
- to list the connection string details use the following command `az eventhubs namespace authorization-rule keys list --name RootManageSharedAccessKey --namespace-name vmandic01`
- afterwards we create a hub instance for the previous namespace with: `az eventhubs eventhub create --name myhub1 --namespace-name vmandic01`
  
## Connecting to an event hub

To be able to send messages to an azure event hub you need to provide:

1. Event hub namespace name
2. Event hub name
3. Shared Access Policy name
4. Primary shared access key

To be able to receive messaged from an azure event hub you need to provide:

1. Event hub namespace name
2. Event hub name
3. Shared Access Policy name
4. Primary shared access key
5. Storage account name
6. Storage account connection string
7. Storage account container name

- continuing with the assignment I had to create a new azure storege account as: `az storage account create --name vmandic01`
- afterwards we created a container in the storage account with `az storage container create --name messages --connection-string <storage account vmandic01 cs>`
- so this failed totally and I am honestly disappointed that this is done with a Java client code, the compilation with maven succeeded but running the compiled java class fails telling me that an invalid shared access primary key was provided, but even after three times repeating and checking no change, so I decided to use the connection string and then even that does not work telling me a different error that the conenction string has invalid parts and could not find vmandic.servicebus.windows.net/null which I do not understand as I did create a hub name `myhub1` which I can see from the portal without an issue

```bash
Exception in thread "main" com.microsoft.azure.eventhubs.IllegalEntityException: The messaging entity 'sb://vmandic01.servicebus.windows.net/null' could not be found. To know more visit https://aka.ms/sbResourceMgrExceptions.  TrackingId:8a8289ed-4268-427e-9bd7-5b68713eca6d_G12, SystemTracker:vmandic01.servicebus.windows.net:null, Timestamp:2021-04-08T20:26:32, errorContext[NS: vmandic01.servicebus.windows.net]
```

- then it took me while to figure out that I need a new connection string and was missing a part at the end: `;EntityPath=myhub1` so after adding that it worked...
- honestly, I fast forwarded this to the end as I do not have the nerves or time to wait or rebuild java apps, I am bit dissapointed there was no C# code as the AZ204 exam uses only C# code
