# AZ204 - (5) - Create a long-running serverless workflow with Durable Functions

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-long-running-serverless-workflow-with-durable-functions/1-introduction>
- durable functions allow long lasting execution and stateful operations
- case: design a long-running business approval process workflow
- core property of durable functions is that they **can retain state between function calls** but still allow a serverless approach to solving a code based problem
- durable functions can wait for a response of one or more other functions or events and then produce a result
- they are used for the fan out / fan in design pattern where one function invokes multiple others and waits for results being processed in parallel
- they allow complex orchestration scenarios with various function types for controlling activation and processing of the workflow with the option of retaining the state
- there are three core durable function types:

1. Client - the process activation function
2. Orchestrator - orchestrates the running and order of functions
3. Activity - the worker role function which handles the actual processing, ie. business logic

- various patterns can be supported: function chaning, fan out / fan in, async HTTP APIs, Monitor, Human interaction
- the same problems might be solved by using Azure Logic Apps but they are design-first approach where Azure Durable Functions are code-first approach based, logic apps offer a bigger suite of connectors, both allow writting custom connector code ie. extensions
- durable functions can run locally (good for developmen) where logic apps run only in the cloud

- assignment: design an approval process workflow based on Durable Functions
- "The Orchestration function will manage a rule in the workflow that starts the escalation activity if the approval activity doesn't return within a specified time."
- we created a http starter client function first, installed `durable-functions` from npm in cloud shell, restarted the function, the default starter function looks like

```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    const client = df.getClient(context);
    const instanceId = await client.startNew(req.params.functionName, undefined, req.body);

    context.log(`Started orchestration with ID = '${instanceId}'.`);

    return client.createCheckStatusResponse(context.bindingData.req, instanceId);
};
```

- next we create another function which is of type durable orchestrator and changed the template code to accomodate our activity functions:

```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");

module.exports = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
    const outputs = [];

    /*
    * We will call the approval activity with a reject and an approved to simulate both
    */

    outputs.push(yield context.df.callActivity("Approval", "Approved"));
    outputs.push(yield context.df.callActivity("Approval", "Rejected"));

    return outputs;
});
```

- finally we creat the activity function "Approval" to actually perform the work
- the starter url is: <https://az204-approvals-vmandic01.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/{functionName}?code=3CRzcmHyuZfN3DaO0wQ9lkk9syqvb6BRnaweMgZgNWgbZRa7SLuOZw==>
- what we do next is create a timer based orchestration function with code as:

```javascript
const df = require("durable-functions");
const moment = require("moment");

module.exports = df.orchestrator(function*(context) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        const deadline = moment.utc(context.df.currentUtcDateTime).add(i, 'd');
        yield context.df.createTimer(deadline.toDate());
        yield context.df.callActivity("SendReminder");
    }
});
```
