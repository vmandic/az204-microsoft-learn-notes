# AZ204 - (20) Store application data with Azure Blob storage

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/store-app-data-with-azure-blob-storage>
- "Azure Blob storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. For example, a blob can hold a PDF document, a JPG image, a JSON file, video content, etc. Blobs aren't limited to common file formats â€” a blob could contain gigabytes of binary data streamed from a scientific instrument, an encrypted message for another application, or data in a custom format for an app you're developing."
- when organizing where to store blobs one must be aware of the service hierarchy: storage account -> container -> blobs
- containers are flat in hierarchy but you can name your blobls with forward slashes to indicate hierarchy and client side libraries usually interpret this as virtual directories, eg. `finance/budgets/2017/q1.xls` is a full and legitimate name of a blob file in a container
- there are three types of blobls: page (VHDs random access designed), block (standard use) and append (log files, write to end only)
- we created a new azure storage account
- next we will store its connection string in azure app service application settings
- core logic for establishing a storage account and container connection in C# is as follows:

```csharp
var storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(storageConfig.ConnectionString);
var blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
var container = blobClient.GetContainerReference(storageConfig.FileContainerName);

container.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();
```

- when fetching blobs (all types) in container use method `ListBlobsSegmentedAsync()` which does not guarantee retrieving all blobs at once so we need to query with an iterator until the iterator reaches an end as follows:

```csharp
BlobContinuationToken continuationToken = null;
BlobResultSegment resultSegment = null;

do
{
    resultSegment = await container.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync(continuationToken);

    // Do work here on resultSegment.Results

    continuationToken = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;
} while (continuationToken != null);
```

- if we wish to filter out only specific blob types we use LINQ's OfType to filter out as:

```csharp
// Get all blobs
var allBlobs = resultSegment.Results.OfType<ICloudBlob>();

// Get only block blobs
var blockBlobs = resultSegment.Results.OfType<CloudBlockBlob>();
```

- for defending against concurrent scenarios you can use blob leases and access conditions
- this was super fun creating a whole app in the cloud

- app service plan was created with:

```bash
az appservice plan create \
--name blob-exercise-plan \
--resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
--sku FREE --location centralus
```

- for our app to read appsettings from our app service account we entere them through the az CLI as:

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set \
--name vmandic01app -g $resg
--settings AzureStorageConfig:ConnectionString=$constring AzureStorageConfig:FileContainerName=files
```

- the web app service was created afterwards with the az CLI as:

```bash
az webapp create \
--name <your-unique-app-name> \
--plan blob-exercise-plan \
--resource-group [sandbox resource group name]
```

- after finsihing the whole app we deployed it as zip to the appservice instance as: `az webapp deployment create --name vmandic01app -g $resg --src site.zip`
