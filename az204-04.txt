AZ204 - (4) Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

- this lecture builds and repeats on 1, 2, 3 reintroducing function bindings, types: input and output and will focus on combining functions
- "bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data from within your code"
- "This is powerful because you can connect to your data sources without having to code specific connection logic (like database connections or web API interfaces)."
- triggers are special input bindings and functions can have ONLY ONE of those defined
- bindings offer interaction with existing azure services and other third party services
- common binding types are (there are more):

1. Blob Storage
2. Azure Service Bus Queues
3. Azure Cosmos DB
4. Azure Event Hubs
5. External Files
6. External Tables
7. HTTP endpoints

- bindings are defined in the function.json document and require three required properties: name, type and direction
- a fourth common property is connection, specifying an app setting key for a connection string which is read from app settings
- depending on type other poperties might be required, eg. blob type requires a path property specifying the blob which is tracked
- here is a sample blob in binding listening to changes in blob named "thumbnail-images/{filename}:
{
  "name": "headshotBlob", (function parameter through which you access the data)
  "type": "blob",
  "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
  "connection": "HeadshotStorageConnection",
  "direction": "in"
}
