# AZ204 - (4) Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

- this lecture builds and repeats on 1, 2, 3 reintroducing function bindings, types: input and output and will focus on combining functions
- "bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data from within your code"
- "This is powerful because you can connect to your data sources without having to code specific connection logic (like database connections or web API interfaces)."
- triggers are special input bindings and functions can have ONLY ONE of those defined
- bindings offer interaction with existing azure services and other third party services
- common binding types are (there are more):

1. Blob Storage
2. Azure Service Bus Queues
3. Azure Cosmos DB
4. Azure Event Hubs
5. External Files
6. External Tables
7. HTTP endpoints

- bindings are defined in the function.json document and require three required properties: name, type and direction
- a fourth common property is connection, specifying an app setting key for a connection string which is read from app settings
- depending on type other poperties might be required, eg. blob type requires a path property specifying the blob which is tracked
- here is a sample blob in binding listening to changes in blob container named "thumbnail-images/{filename}:

```json
{
  "name": "headshotBlob", (function parameter through which you access the data)
  "type": "blob",
  "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}", (specific to blob type, specifies the container and if needed a specific file or filetype or any file as is specified here)
  "connection": "HeadshotStorageConnection",
  "direction": "in"
}
```

- case scenario: build a function to lookup bookmark URLs by bookmark ID from a Azure Cosmos DB

- assignment: create a function app with HTTPTrigger based function with all the defaults, leave auth level to "Function", test through browser with generated URL of the function to see it is working

- input binding types:

1. blob storage
2. azure cosmos DB
3. mobile apps
4. table storage

- each input binding defines its own set of binding expressions, a special syntax to setup / query the input binding parameter ie. data, "For example, if you have a Service Bus Queue binding, you could use a binding expression to get the name of the queue from App Settings."
- types of binding expressions:

1. app settings
2. trigger file name
3. trigget metadata
4. JSON payloads
5. New GUID
6. Current data and time

- "Most expressions are identified by wrapping them in curly braces. However, app setting binding expressions are wrapped in percent signs rather than curly braces. For example if the blob output binding path is %Environment%/newblob.txt and the Environment app setting value is Development, a blob will be created in the Development container."
- assignment: create a new Azure Cosmos DB service which will be used to speicfy and input binding for our function
- the trigger, input and output bindings at the moment work only with SQL API (document based) and Graph (Gremlin graph based) API account types
- after creating an azure cosmos db service we need to create a container within it to store our user data ie. documents
- when creating an Azure Cosmos DB binding, the "Document ID" configuration field is used to specify the binding expression, in our example that is the partition key we specified as id, and the expression will be {id} (with brackets!) "This syntax is known as a binding expression. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID to look up. Because IDs are unique in our collection, the binding will return either 0 (not found) or 1 (found) documents."
- the function really works... eg. https://az204-04-vmandic01.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?id=docs&code=TrCPp/mf/9WMdDiJoBpjFo4LE6RCoa5JSeWoILuhFeO8XIhK/dpI/A==

- we continue on with output bindings, there is alot more of them from Blog Storage to Twilio SMS text: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/6-write-data-with-output-bindings-portal-lesson
- HTTP output bindings require a HTTP input trigger in use, useful for webhook integrations
- output bindings need the direction property to be set as "out"

- case scenario: add bookmark to DB if it does not exist, the request will pass the URL alongside the key / ID, we will also add an additional process with Azure Queue Storage to generate messages to another function for generating QR codes input URLs

- azure queue storage allow messages up to 64KB and a queue can contain millions of messages up to the total capacity of the storage account
- we added an additional queue output binding alongside the Azure Cosmos DB Bookmarks collection writing, all the in/out bindings are specified as:

```json
 {
      "name": "bookmark",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "cosmosDB",
      "databaseName": "func-io-learn-db",
      "collectionName": "Bookmarks",
      "connectionStringSetting": "az204-04-vmandic01_DOCUMENTDB",
      "id": "{id}",
      "partitionKey": "{id}"
    },
    {
      "name": "newbookmark",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "cosmosDB",
      "databaseName": "func-io-learn-db",
      "collectionName": "Bookmarks",
      "connectionStringSetting": "az204-04-vmandic01_DOCUMENTDB",
      "partitionKey": "{id}"
    },
    {
      "name": "newmessage",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "queue",
      "queueName": "bookmarks-post-process",
      "connection": "storageaccountlearnab62_STORAGE"
    }
```

- for exercise in summary lecture I decided to create a queue triggered function to read from "bookmarks-post-process" queue and print to console log
- the new queue trigger based function is:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, myQueueItem) {
    context.log('New URL received:', myQueueItem.url);
};
```

- the input binding is (function.json):

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "myQueueItem",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "queueName": "bookmarks-post-process",
      "connection": "storageaccountlearnab62_STORAGE"
    }
  ]
}
```
