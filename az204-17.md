# AZ204 - (17) Create an Azure Storage account

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-azure-storage-account>
- this lecture is about azure storage accounts, how many we need and what types of services in them we need
- azure storage accounts offer four different services: blob, file, table and queue
- the core settings of an azure storage account are:

1. subscription - the azure one
2. location - the geolocation zone like centralus or westus2
3. performance - Standard offers all services but Premium offers block or append blobls or special premium file share
4. replication - azure maintains 3 copies of the data within the DC, that is LRS (locally redundant storage), GRS offers replication to other world DCs
5. access tier - controls time of access to blobs only, cool (cheaper) & hot (pricyer)
6. secure transfer required - HTTP or HTTPS
7. virtual networks - a security feature to control inbound access requests only from the selected vNets

## Storage account kind

There are three types of storage accounts:

1. StorageV2 - latest
2. Storage - legacy, does not support all features
3. Blob storage - legacy, only for block and append blobs

- StorageV2 is the recommended choice by Microsoft with using the deployment technique Resource Manager as default

- assignment: create an an azure storage account through azure portal, easy now :-)
