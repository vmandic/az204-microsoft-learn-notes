- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/prepare-your-dev-environment-for-azure-development>
- this course is ultra begginer level it is about setting up visual studio and vscode for Azure dev
- i selected vscode development track and this is useful: "Many of the extensions target Azure features and products. For example, there are extensions that provide features such as Docker support, subscription management, tooling for the Azure CLI, database access, and Azure Storage API integration."
- so I installed some extensions such as "Azure App Service" extension... and we are done :D ...5 minutes...
