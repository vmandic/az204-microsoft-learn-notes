# AZ204 - (16) Choose a data storage approach in Azure

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure>
- this course is about types of data and how to store in Azure, we explore three types of data: structured (relational), semi-structured and unstructured
- the three popular serialization languages are: xml, json and yaml
- semi-structured data is known as NoSQL also which does not support relations the same way as structured data with foreign keys
- three types of NoSQL databases can be: key-value, graph and document
- in Azure you can leverage NoSQL with Azure Cosmos DB
- unstructured data is represented as binary files such as images, audio or video files, but also log files, text files, office files and similar

## Fantastic questions to ask your self when modeling or working with data

1. Will you be doing simple lookups using an ID?
2. Do you need to query the database for one or more fields?
3. How many create, update, and delete operations do you expect?
4. Do you need to run complex analytical queries?
5. How quickly do these operations need to complete?

- when you need to group data operations you should use transactions: **"A transaction is a logical group of database operations that execute together."**
- transactions are defined by a set of four requirements: ACID ie. Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
- transactional databases are often called OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) - fast, reliable and realtime with lots of users, process uncomplex transactions
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems support less users and have longer response times, process large and complex transactions
