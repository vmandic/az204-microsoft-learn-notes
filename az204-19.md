# AZ204 - (19) Secure your Azure Storage account

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-azure-storage-account>
- in this module we will learn how to secure our azure storage account
- azure storage accounts offer:

1. protection of data at rest
2. protection of data at transit (secure transfer feature)
3. supports browser cross domain access (CORS)
4. control of who can access data (AAD, RBAC etc.)
5. auditing of storage access (also analytics logs included)

- at rest data is encrypted with industry standard AES cipher and is FIPS 140-2 compliant
- VHDs can be encrypted with BitLocker and dm-crypt for Linuxes
- Azure Key Vault stores the keys automatically to manage disk-encrpytion keys and secrets
- "Azure Storage accounts can create authorized apps in Active Directory to control access to the data in blobs and queues. This authentication approach is the best solution for apps that use Blob storage or Queue storage."
- for accessing the storage account we need to use storage account keys (primary or secondary)
- for third party application usage use shared access signatures instead (SAS keys)
- when managing security of a storage account we can change the vNet of the account to connect only to selected networks
- "Azure Defender for Storage provides an extra layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts."
- "Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides a first-class data lake solution that enables enterprises to consolidate their data. It's built on Azure Blob storage, so it inherits all of the security features we've reviewed in this module."
- azure data lake is protected  with AAD OAuth 2 bearer tokens
