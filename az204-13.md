# AZ204 - (13) Implement message-based communication workflows with Azure Service Bus

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-message-workflows-with-service-bus>
- case: pizza delivery chain where we update the client who ordered the pizza about every stage of pizza making :-) to their phone app, even as the pizza arrives to their delivery location we publish location updates, sometimes during peak events pizza ordering fails and we need a scalable and reliable decoupled architecture redesign to meet the future demands without failures
- "In this module, we'll learn how Azure Service Bus can help build an application that stays reliable during peak demand."
- "you will see how to use Azure Service Bus topics and queues in a distributed architecture"
- 1st assignment is to decide between messages and events - the two core types of datagrams
- "Service Bus is designed to handle messages."
- **"Azure Service Bus can exchange messages in three different ways: queues, topics, and relays."**
- "Queues decouple the source and destination components to insulate destination components from high demand."
- "A topic is similar to a queue but can have multiple subscriptions."
- "Use a topic if you want each message to be delivered to more than one destination component."
- **basic pricing**: "Topics are not supported in the Basic pricing tier."

## Relays

- "A relay is an object that performs synchronous, two-way communication between applications. Unlike queues and topics, it is not a temporary storage location for messages."

## Service bus and Storage queues

- storage queues are simpler but less sophistecated and flexible than service bus
- service bus allows bigger messages of 256 KB (standard tier) or 1 MB (premium tier) vs 64 KB of storage queue
- service bus offers at-least-once or at-most-once, FIFO, transactions - groupping of messages, role base security and does not require receivers to poll the queue
- storage queue has unlimited queue size vs 80 GB limit of service bus
- maintains a log of all messages

- queue is one-to-one, topic is one-to-many strategy

- assignment: create a Service Bus namespace, which will contain both a queue and a topic with subscriptions
- we are creating a "standard" pricing tier service bus instance to enable topics as they are not supported in "basic" pricing tier
- we created a queue and a topic in this exercise with the default options only including partitioning
- for the topic we created two different subscriptions depending on the geographical region
- now we will write some code to send and receive the messages using the NuGet lib `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus` and its core class `QueueClient` on both sides

## Connect to service bus from code

Two pieces of data are required:

1. Service Bus instance namespace or endpoint address, the FQDN under servicebus.windows.net domain
2. An access key which allows a specific service under a service bus instance like queue, topic or relay

This data is provided to the QueueClient instance in the form of a connection string which can be obtained from the portal

- for exercise I built a console app `SenderApp` that uses the `QueueClient` to send an acutal message, fun! :-), the message actually showed up in the portal
- next we build an actual app but this time from the Azure CLI shell in the tutorial web page, we start off by cloning a git repo as:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-connect-services-together.git

cd ~/mslearn-connect-services-together/implement-message-workflows-with-service-bus/src/start
code .
```

- so we have written a whole app in the Azure CLI that sends and receives messages which is pretty darn cool EXCEPT the part they teach folks to use GetAwaiter().GetResult() which is not OK :-(
- next we continue to write code for publishing and subscribing to a topic message
- **"If you want every message sent to be delivered to all subscribing components, you'll use topics."**
- the core difference is that you need to use a `TopicClient` class instance to handle working with topics (publishing) and to receive message you need a `SubscriptionClient` class instance for receiving topic messages
- subscribers can filter topics with three methods:

1. Boolean filters: TrueFilter (all messages) and FalseFilter (blocks all messages, like it is switched off from listening)
2. SQL filters: write a WHERE clause to filter out only the interested messages
3. Correlation filters: "holds a set of conditions that are matched against the properties of each message. If the property in the filter and the property on the message have the same value, it is considered a match."

- eg. if we had an "OrderCancellation" topic each pizza store could filter out only the orders by their StoreId through SQL filters but a more efficient solution would be a correlation filter instead
- I won't be coding the topic code here as in the next lesson we do it in Azure CLI but the code is 95% the same with changes in class names only literally...
- next we code up an actual topic publisher and consumer(s) app(s)
- one big core difference in in consuming the messages with the `SubscriptionClient` CTOR which needs the topic name and the subscription name, eg. in our demo case we filter out to "Americas" subscription specifically in the topic "salesperformancemessages" and "pop" messages only for that topic/subscription
- **so a very important observation here is to acknowledge that popping a message to specific subscription leaves it unprocessed in the topic for all the other subscriptions if they have not yet requested them to be processed**, the "EuropeAndAfrica" subscription message I've sent still remains in the "Active" queue by looking through the Service Bus Explorer view in the portal for the topic in question
- we use the az CLI to check this also to receive 0:

```bash
az servicebus topic subscription show \
    --resource-group learn-98c7a878-3b8c-4f42-897d-9853f0b412ec \
    --namespace-name salessteamapp-vmandic01 \
    --topic-name salesperformancemessages \
    --name Americas \
    --query messageCount

> 0
```

- if we substitute the subscription name then we get 1:

```bash
az servicebus topic subscription show \
    --resource-group learn-98c7a878-3b8c-4f42-897d-9853f0b412ec \
    --namespace-name salessteamapp-vmandic01 \
    --topic-name salesperformancemessages \
    --name EuropeAndAfrica \
    --query messageCount

> 1
```
