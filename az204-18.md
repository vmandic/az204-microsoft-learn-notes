# AZ204 - (18) Connect an app to Azure Storage

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/connect-an-app-to-azure-storage>
- the storage account services can be accessed through HTTP REST API and through client code SDK libraries
- blob storage is designed for unstructured data such as images, audio or video, or logs or any large binary files
- there are three types of blob storage service types:

1. Block blob - text or binary up to 5 TB to be read as a whole
2. Page blob - holds random access files up to 8 TB in size, used for VHD storage of azure VMs
3. Append blobs - like block blob but designed for append operation for writting log files, up to 195 GB files

- unit 4 does not complete... have to come back to it, it is az CLI: `az storage account create --name vmandic01 -g $rg -l centralus --sku Storage_LRS`
- nextwe look into the REST API to interactwith the storage account
- for example, listing all blobs in a container could be done with: `GET https://[url-for-service-account]/?comp=list&include=metadata`
- for accessing the storage account programatically we need the security access key which we have two for each account we create, in short we need the connection string for a storage account
- two keys exist so you can rotate them often, when changing an existing one to the other, the old one is invalidated and replaced with a new one
- besides using the SAK we can use SAS (shared access signatures) which specify access permissions and duration within them offering limited access
