# AZ204 - (6) Develop, test, and publish Azure Functions by using Azure Functions Core Tools

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/1-introduction>
- case: car dealership service looking to modernzie their business workflows
- we will be learning how to use the Azure Functions Core Tools with the Azure CLI
- "The Azure Functions Core Tools let you develop and run functions on your local computer from the command line."
- core tools enable three main goals:

1. generate files and folders to develop funcs on local computer
2. run funcs locally and debug them
3. publish funcs to azure

- the core tools are CLI tool accessible through the command line `func`
- functions are grouped in azure under a function app that shares acommon set of config values and must be built for the same language runtime eg. NodeJS or C#
- when developing locally then we build under a functions project, a folder which contains code and config files which define the function
- one function project is the equivalent of function app service in azure and can contain multiple functions that use the same language runtime
- running `func init` starts a CLI wizard to create the functions app, you select a runtime (dotnet, node, python, powershell) and then a language depending on the runtime, and afterwards some files are generated (if selected node): host.json, package.json, .gitignore and local.setting.json
-  running the `func new` will create a new function in the current function app project also by running a wizard to select a template
-  to run functions locally you use the command `func start` from the functions project folder, after processing you get a list of URLs you can invoke to test the actual function being deployed on the local host
- assignment: use core tools from Azure Cloud Shell CLI to build a loan interest calculation azure function
- after we created the func we tested it from the shell with `curl "http://localhost:7071/api/simple-interest?principal=5000&rate=.035&term=36" -w "\n"`
- to publish to azure use the CLI command: `func azure functionapp publish <app_name>` from the function app project root, the app name is the function app in Azure that will be used, it can be different from the project folder on your computer
- so we built a Node JS function with some math, updated it through the cloud shell with vscode integrated to it and pushed it to azure
- before pushing to azure we created the azure resources directly with the az CLI as follows:

```bash
RESOURCEGROUP=learn-782f6f5b-9b80-4eaf-b0a4-f85b7466e709
STORAGEACCT=learnstorage$(openssl rand -hex 5)
FUNCTIONAPP=learnfunctions$(openssl rand -hex 5)

az storage account create \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCEGROUP" \
  --name "$STORAGEACCT" \
  --kind StorageV2 \
  --location centralus

az functionapp create \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCEGROUP" \
  --name "$FUNCTIONAPP" \
  --storage-account "$STORAGEACCT" \
  --runtime node \
  --consumption-plan-location centralus \
  --functions-version 2
```
