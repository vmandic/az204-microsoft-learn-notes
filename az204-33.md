# AZ204 - (33) Configure security policies to manage data

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/configure-security-policies-to-manage-data>
- we will learn how to classify data, configure data retention requirements and explore ownership and sovereignty
- there are three type od data to classify ie. recognize:

1. data at rest - apply Microsoft Azure Disk Encryption (BitLocker for Windows and DM-Crypt Linux)
2. data in process
3. data in transit - use SSL, VPN, Azure ExpressRoute (mass data transit)

- to protect you databases adhere the Azure Data Security offering, ie. Azure Defender for SQL: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-defender-for-sql>

- when classifying data take in consideration two types of annotations:

1. Labels - define the sensitivity level of the data stored
2. Information type - provide additional granularity into the type of data stored

- "SQL data discovery and classification comes with a built-in set of sensitivity labels and information types and discovery logic. You can now customize this taxonomy and define a set and ranking of classification constructs specifically for your environment."

- in unit 3 we createa a sql server and database (from sample data) on it and activate azure defender
- "SQL IP brings a set of advanced services and SQL capabilities":

1. Azure SQL auditing - tracks reads and writes to the DB to an audit log in the Azure Storage account, log analytics or event hub
2. Data Discovery & Classifications - built in to Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure Synapse Analytics; advanced capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling and reporting the sensitive data from the DBs
3. Dynamic data masking - limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users
4. Security Center - scans DBs and makes recommenditions to improve security and manage security alerts
5. Transparent data encryption - encryption of all DB related stuff at rest including logs

- we now tested the Data classification and labeling feature on Azure, which is superb for auditing purposes... this is really a fantastic feature, best thing about it is we used the recommended classification then modified to our needs to a more precise information type and sensitivity level

- "A data retention policy defines the principles for data recovery and disposal and is enforced in the same manner as data reclassification. These tasks are typically performed by the custodian and administrator roles as a collaborative task."
- "Immutable storage for Azure Blob Storage enables users to store business-critical data in a write once, read many (WORM) state."
- the immutable storage enables:

1. Time-based retention policy support - WORM 1, users set policies to store data for a specified interval
2. Legal hold policy support - WORM 2
3. Support for al lblobl tiers
4. Container level configuration
5. Audit logging support (The audit log is kept for the lifetime of the container)

- "A container can have both a legal hold and a time-based retention policy simultaneously"

- "Digital information is always subject to the laws of the country or region where it's stored" - this is data sovereignty
- "It's recommended that you configure business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) across regional pairs to benefit from Azure's isolation and VM policies."
- when designing a system for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) you should plan to have an intra geographical region pair and pair in another region
