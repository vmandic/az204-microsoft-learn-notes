# AZ204 Microsoft Learn courses for "Azure Developer challenge" overview and caveats

The exam AZ-204 gets updated alot, 2 to 3 times a year so you have to stay up to date with what is tested in detail. Look up the PDF on the exam's official site on Microsoft and find the requirements list. **This challenge (which I go through here on Microsoft Learn) does not prepare you for all the requirements.**

## Some caveats or stuff you need to reafirm

In brief, the exam goes a lot through az CLI and there is a lot of source code involved with Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos, Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, Event grid, Event hub, Key vault (and others). Some of these are looked into in these courses but I'd say not enough. My warm advice is to go own your own pace and cover a basic to advance usage scenario with all of these services, _CRUD_ simulation will do in most cases.
