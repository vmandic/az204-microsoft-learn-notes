# AZ204 - (31) Deploy Azure SQL Database

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/deploy-azure-sql-database>
- learn to provision and use Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for SQL Server
- Azure SQL database is offered in three different deployment options:

1. A single database
2. Elastic pools - a gourp of databases managed together
3. Hypersclae Database - a single database scalable beyond 4 TB limit of Azure SQL

There are two core principles to choosing a right size of service that is offered, through:

1. DTU (data transaction units) - based of compute, storage and I/O resources
2. vCore - based off virtual cores workload selection

- additional useful features of Azure SQL are: automatic backup (full, differential, log), patching, built-in HA, enhancement features
- there are three basic service tiers to choose from:

1. Basic
2. Standard
3. Premium

- the vCore purchase is also differentiated in three categories:

1. General Purpose
2. Business Critical (local SSDs instead Azure Storage, has a built in read-only database replica useful for OLAP / reporting)
3. Hyperscale

## Serverless & vCore models compute tiers

- "Azure SQL Database **serverless is a compute tier that will automatically scale up or down** the resources for a given database based on demand."
- "Another difference between serverless and the normal vCore model of Azure SQL Database is that with serverless you can specify a minimum and maximum number of vCores. Memory and I/O limits are proportional to the range that is specified."
- "You should note that databases that are not deployed as serverless are referred to as “provisioned”."
- serverless tier does not offer all features such as geo-replication, long-term backup retention, jobs DB, sync DB in SQL Data Sync service
- **Serverless is billed per second based on the number of vCores utilized.**

- in unit 4 we are discussing elastic pools, creating one, adding an existing SQL server database to it, using the existing SQL server from unit 3
- "An elastic pool is a good fit for multi-tenant databases where each tenant has its own copy of the database. Balance the workload across databases so as not to allow one database to monopolize all the pool’s resources."

## Azure SQL managed instances

- "Azure SQL Managed Instance allows for easy migration paths for existing applications by allowing restores from on-premises backups. Unlike Azure SQL Database"
- "A standalone Managed Instance offers a 99.99% Service Level Agreement (SLA) which guarantees at most 52.60 minutes of downtime per year."
- "In order to restore from one instance to another, both instances must reside within the same Azure subscription as well as the same Azure region. You also cannot restore the entire managed instance, only individual databases within the Managed Instance itself."
- "As with Azure SQL Database, you cannot restore over an existing database"
