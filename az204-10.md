# AZ204 - (10) Expose multiple Azure Function apps as a consistent API by using Azure API Management

- url: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-serverless-api-with-functions-api-management/
- in this course we will learn about Azure API Management service and integrating azure functions with it
- by using Azure API Management (APIM) one can combine disparate services into one web API service which is ideal for a microservice architecture where each service evolves on its own but lacks a shared API or interface
-  you use the APIM to "publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs."
-  "API Management handles all the tasks involved in mediating API calls, including request authentication and authorization, rate limit and quota enforcement, request and response transformation, logging and tracing, and API version management."
- assignment: we git clone a sample repo that uses a setup.sh to create two functions, then we create a new APIM
- we configure the APIM to use the two functions under `/products` and `/orders` routes
- the new APIM route I enabled is: `https://productfunctionea0f4b1dd5-apim.azure-api.net/products/ProductDetails?id=3`
- in the next chapter we will add another internal API (function) to our APIM
