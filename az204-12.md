# AZ204 - (12) Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services

- url: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-a-messaging-model-in-azure-to-connect-your-services>
- in this module we will take a close look into the offerings of queueing mechanisms: Storage que, Event Hub, Event Grid and Service Bus
- "This module shows you how to choose the best technology for your communication task."
- as I already failed once :-) for the AZ204, what I recall greatly is that this is questioned in detail on the exam with scenarios and exact code snippets, **so whoever might be reading this, take extra notice in this and upcoming message queueing modules** as it will pay off for sure

- case: "distributed music-sharing application" ...we have an music sharing application consisting of mobile app, web API and azure SQL DB and in high demand we lose requests in between these services and now are looking in reliable message queueing services from Azure to chime in and rejuvinate the issues
- **"The first thing to understand about a communication is whether it sends messages or events."**

## Messages

- a message contains raw data iteself designed to go from a sender to a receiver
- the sender expects the message content to be processed in a certain way by the destination receiver
- use case: user uploads the song which is the raw message data to the web API

## Events

- an event is light message without the data iteself
- an event is dispatched / published to subscribers usually via a broadcast strategy and the sending party does not need to acknowledge the receiver / subscriber
- its a form of notification to all the subscribers, it is usually a "fan out" message sending mechanism
- events are usually composed to trigger other events forming a related and ordered series of events
- use case: notify the end users that a new song is available on their frontend apps

## Choosing the right messaging solution

- "For each communication, consider the following question: Does the sending component expect the communication to be processed in a particular way by the destination component?"

## Azure message-based systems

1. Azure Queue Storage - a message que linked to Storage account offering a REST API interface
2. Azure Service Bus - a message broker system offering more features related to the message itself, its lifecycle and processing (reliability)

- Azure Service Bus offers topics which act as sub-queues that can have their own subscribers

## Message delivery guarantees

1. At-least-once - the sent out message can be processed by more than one receiver (eg. first message processing times out)
2. At-most-once - the message will be processed at most once but there is a chance that it might never be processed
3. First-in-first-out (FIFO) - ensures an ordering to how messages are processed

- messages can be grouped under a transaction so we can guarantee that if the whole group succeeds or fails if one at least fails

## Use Service Bus topics if you

- Need multiple receivers to handle each message

## Use Service Bus queues if you

- Need an At-Most-Once delivery guarantee
- Need a FIFO guarantee
- Need to group messages into transactions
- Want to receive messages without polling the queue
- Need to provide a role-based access model to the queues
- Need to handle messages larger than 64 KB but less than 256 KB
- Queue size will not grow larger than 80 GB
- Want to publish and consume batches of messages

## Use Queue storage if you

- Need an audit trail of all messages that pass through the queue
- Expect the queue to exceed 80 GB in size
- Want to track progress for processing a message inside of the queue

## Choosing the right eventing solution

- eventing should be used for all notifications based scenarios, ie. lightweight messaging that some event occured on which you wish to act / process logic afterwards on the subscribers side

## Azure Event Grid

- runs on top of __Azure Service Fabric__ service and distributes services from different sources
- "Event Grid was created to make it easier to build event-based and serverless applications on Azure."
- the event grid has several concepts to acknowledge:

1. events - what happend
2. (source) event sources - where the event took place
3. (publishing route) topics - the endpoints where publishers send events
4. (subscription route) subscriptions - the endpoints to route the events
5. (receiver) event handlers - the app or service reacting to the event

- "The event sources send events to the Event Grid and the Event Grid forwards relevant events to the subscribers. Event Grid use topics to decide which events to send to which handlers. **Events sources tag each event with one or more topics**, and event handlers subscribe to the topics they are interested in."
- "Events are the data messages passing through Event Grid that describe what has taken place. Each event is self-contained, can be up to 64 KB, and contains several pieces of information based on a schema defined by Event Grid", example event JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

- **"Event Grid sends an event to indicate something has happened or changed. However, the actual object that was changed is not part of the event data. Instead, a URL or identifier is often passed to reference the changed object."**
- event sources define their own event types (logical...), eg. if the event source is Azure Storage then the event type can obviously be blob created, custom web apps create their own user specified event types
- **Azure Event Hub has the concept of an event publisher which is often confused with the event source.** - NOT TO BE CONFUSED!
- the source is the system publishing the event, but the publisher is the person behind the system initiating the event
- event topics are represented by public endpoints to which the event sources publish (send) events
- "Create two custom topics and let event handlers subscribe to the one that interests them. Event subscribers can filter for the event types they want from a specific topic."
- "Topics are divided into system topics, and custom topics."
- "A (event) subscription can also filter events by their type or subject, so you can ensure an event handler only receives relevant events."
- "For example, Azure Functions **(as the event handler role here)** can execute code in response to the new song being added to the Blob storage account. Subscribers can decide which events they want to handle and Event Grid will efficiently notify each interested subscriber when a new event is available - no polling required."

## Event grid event sources

1. Azure Subscriptions and Resource Groups - act upon azure config changes and fire off relevant grid events
2. ACI (container registry) - docker image changes fire off grid events
3. Event hub - hubs can fire off event grid events, typicall when files are captured
4. Service bus - fire off events eg. when there are active messages with no active listeners
5. Storage accounts - on blob change, files, table or queue message changes fire grid events
6. Media services - a specialized azure service for hosting and handling media files such as audio or video
7. IoT hub - use an IoT hub to send IoT telemetry and trigger grid events on upcoming telemtry data income
8. Custom events - use the REST API or Azure SDK for Java, Go, .NET...

## Event grid event handlers

1. Azure functions - input bindings
2. Webhooks
3. Logic apps
4. Microsoft Power Automate (MS Flow)

- use event grid when you need: simplicty, advanced filtering, fan-out, reliability, pay-per-event and "one-event-at-a-time" delivery

## Event hubs

- "is an intermediary for the publish-subscribe communication pattern. Unlike Event Grid, however, it is optimized for extremely high throughput, a large number of publishers, security, and resiliency."
- event hubs can partition the data ingest into buffers into which the communication is saved making the event hub not completely ephemeral
- subscribers can rely on the "buffer" to catch up with missed events, the events are by default held for 24 hours before they automatically expire
- "the buffers are called partitions because the data is divided amongs them"
- every event hub has at least 2 partitions where each can have multiple sets of same or different subscribers
- "capture" is a feature allowing event hubs to forward events to Azure Data Lake or Azure Storege for permanent persistance
- event hubs offer an authentication mechanism based on a token
- it is usually paired with Azure Stream Analytics to allow almost real-time complex analytics of event ingestion, where in this case the Stream Analytics is the event subscriber
- message size is max 1 MB

## Choose event hubs when

1. You need to support authenticating a large number of publishers
2. You need to save a stream of events to Data Lake or Blob storage
3. You need aggregation or analytics on your event stream
4. You need reliable messaging or resiliency

- "Otherwise, if you need a simple event publish-subscribe infrastructure, with trusted publishers (for instance, your own web server), you should choose Event Grid."
- "Event Hubs lets you build a big data pipeline capable of processing millions of events per second with low latency."
